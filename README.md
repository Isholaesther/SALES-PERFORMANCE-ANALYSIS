## üìå Project Overview  
- **Initial Dataset Size:** 200 records  
- **Final Dataset Size (after cleaning):** 96 records  
- **Tool Used:** Microsoft Excel  
- **New Columns Created:**  
  - `Month Name` ‚Üí extracted from Sale Date  
  - `Total Sales` ‚Üí calculated as `Quantity Sold √ó Price`  

The analysis was guided by stakeholder questions, focusing on product performance, sales trends, and return patterns.

## üßπ Data Cleaning  
Steps taken to prepare the dataset:  
- Removed duplicate rows  
- Corrected inconsistent date formats  
- Standardized product names and categories  
- Filled or removed rows with missing values  
- Removed rows with missing **Sale Date** or **Status** (essential for analysis)  
- Created new calculated columns (`Month Name`, `Total Sales`)  

After cleaning, **104 invalid/missing records** were dropped, leaving **96 valid rows**.

## üîç Exploratory Analysis  
Performed the following:  
- Revenue and sales by product and category  
- Returns analysis by product and location  
- Average pricing within categories  
- Seasonal patterns using `Month Name`  
- Dashboard creation for KPI visualization

### 4. Highest & Lowest Store Sales  
- **Highest:** Lagos  
- **Lowest:** Port Harcourt  

### 5. Average Price per Category  
- Calculated using `AVERAGEIF()`.  
- Outliers identified, especially in Appliances.  

### 6. Best Performing Products

- **By Revenue:** Fridge, Laptop  

### 7. Overstocking/Understocking  
- **Overstocked:** Microwave (low sales, high stock).  
- **Risk of understocking:** Blender (high demand).  

### 8. Highest Return Rates by Location  
- **Ibadan and Abuja** showed higher percentages of returns.  
- Possible reasons: supply chain inefficiencies or product quality issues.
